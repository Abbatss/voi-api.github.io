        	<h1 id="what-is-maas-pro">What is MaaS Pro?</h1>
<p>MaaS Pro allows end-users to book and ride vois through partner apps.</p>

<h1 id="payment-flow">Payment flow</h1>
<p>When a user finishes a ride, Voi calculates the total price of the ride and returns this to the partner. The partner then charges the end user for the ride. On a regular basis, the partner will provide Voi with invoicing material, including a list of refunded rides, VAT and total amount owed, per day and city(CEST timezone). Voi will then create an invoice with potential comissions deducted and send it to the partner. The invoice will be sent in the local currency of each city. How often invoices are sent is defined in the contract between Voi and the partner.</p>

<h1 id="prices-and-fees">Prices and fees</h1>
<p>Pricing is under active development and constantly evolving, but it typically consists of a fixed fee and a minute fee. Below are other conditions that will also impact the price of the ride. Regardless of what the price is, this will always be returned to you so you can charge the end user.</p>

<p><strong>End ride fines</strong> If the user leaves the scooter in a non parking zone, Voi may add an additional fee before ending the ride. This will be included in the end-ride charge.</p>

<p><strong>Free rides</strong> If the users ride for less than 100 meters or less than 2 minutes, we will not charge for the ride. It is optional for the partner to present reciepts and/or add theese rides to the invoicing material.</p>

<p><strong>Refunds</strong> The partner is responsible for performing refunds, when this is done is defined in the customer support criteria. Sometimes, Voi customer support also requests the partner to perform refunds.</p>

<p><strong>Parking fees and other later charges</strong> Voi don’t performs any additional charges after the ride is ended.</p>

<h1 id="fraud">Fraud</h1>
<p>The partner is responsible for making sure they can collect the money from the end-user, including fraud prevention. (We do a 5€ pre auth payment before the first ride. The partner can do what ever they want.)</p>
